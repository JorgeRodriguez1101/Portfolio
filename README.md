# Project 1
### **Title:** PEAnalyzer - Malware Classification with Python & Tkinter

### Overview

PEAnalyzer is an innovative malware analysis tool tailored for students. Built using Python with a Tkinter GUI, it facilitates the extraction of features from Portable Executable (PE) files, allowing for effective training of machine learning models and the classification of files as either malicious or benign.


# Project 2
### **Title:** Machine Learning Based Domain Generating Algorithm Detection

### Overview

This project harnesses machine learning techniques to achieve a 94% accuracy rate in detecting domains generated by Domain Generating Algorithms (DGAs), commonly used in botnet command-and-control operations. By classifying these domains as either malicious or legitimate, our tool, the "Malware Domain Analysis Tool," provides actionable intelligence to combat cyber threats. Developed in Python for Windows, this user-friendly interface facilitates data processing and allows customization across various sophisticated algorithms like Random Forest and SVM. Recognized as a finalist at the UTRGV 2024 Engineers Week competition, this tool proves essential for small businesses aiming to enhance cybersecurity without heavy IT investments. Our results demonstrate high precision in identifying threats, significantly reducing false alarms for legitimate domains.
